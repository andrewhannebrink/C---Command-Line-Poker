CSE 332 README.txt - Lab 5

I did not run into many errors while developing this lab. I implemented a sidepot that gives remaining sidepots to second place players if they had a sidepot after the winning player finished betting, and continues to give back chips to lower ranking players if they had more significant sidepots, until the last player does not have an applicable sidepot. Then they win the pot.

I also tried to implement razz, but I think I messed up an if statement somewhere, because it doesnt work entirely perfectly.

Otherwise, I have few to no errors in my code I believe.
